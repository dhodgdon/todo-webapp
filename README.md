# Overview

This is basic to-do list web app built on a full MERN stack.

To run the application, open two terminal windows and navigate to the client and api directories respectively ('cd client' and 'cd api' if you are in the todo-webapp directory). Run 'npm start' in both of these terminals. Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 (if React hasn't already opened it for you). You are now free to make your own to-do list!

I wrote this application to learn how to write a fullstack MERN application as well as update my web development skills.

# Web Pages

The web page allows you to create, complete, and delete tasks from your to-do list. These task items are created dynamically.

I will add a login page to this application in the future.
